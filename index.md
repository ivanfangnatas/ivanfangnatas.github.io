## 🌟 About RedStone

Welcome to the RedStone Oracles Monorepo! This repository contains the essential components for the RedStone oracles ecosystem. We aim to provide you with reliable and up-to-date data for your decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. 

RedStone changes how we deliver on-chain data. Data is linked to a user's transaction and removed after use. This approach lowers gas fees and avoids relying on costly storage.
